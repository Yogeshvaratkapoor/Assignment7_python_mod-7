        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, usually for cleanup tasks like closing files or releasing resources.\n",

        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",

        "- Multithreading uses multiple threads in the same process (good for I/O-bound tasks).\n",

        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The else block in Python's exception handling structure is used to define a set of statements that should be executed only if no exception occurs in the try block. It acts as a clean-up area where you can confidently write logic that depends on the success of the try block. This helps in keeping the try block concise and separates normal logic from error-handling logic, improving readability and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "- Python’s logging module defines several standard logging levels to indicate the severity of events. These levels, in increasing order of severity, are: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. DEBUG is used for detailed diagnostic output, INFO for general events, WARNING for events that might cause problems, ERROR for serious problems, and CRITICAL for very severe issues that might prevent the program from continuing.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "- The os.fork() method is specific to Unix-like systems and creates a new child process by duplicating the current process, giving both processes separate memory spaces. On the other hand, the multiprocessing module is a high-level, cross-platform interface for spawning processes. It provides better support for process management, inter-process communication, and avoids platform-specific limitations, making it the preferred approach for writing portable and scalable Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "- Closing a file in Python is crucial because it ensures that all data written to the file is properly flushed and saved, and system resources like file descriptors are released. Failing to close a file can lead to data corruption, file locking issues, or memory leaks, especially when dealing with many open files or large applications. Using the with statement is a best practice as it automatically closes files after their use.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "- The file.read() method reads the entire contents of a file into a single string, which is useful when you want to process everything at once. In contrast, file.readline() reads just one line at a time, which is more memory-efficient for large files or when processing files line by line. Choosing between the two depends on the file size and the nature of the data processing task.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "- The logging module in Python is used to track events that occur during program execution. It provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs and supports writing logs to different destinations like the console, files, or external systems. This helps in debugging, monitoring, and maintaining applications by providing insights into the flow and health of the program without interrupting its execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "- The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system and perform file system operations like creating, deleting, renaming, or moving files and directories. It also allows you to retrieve file properties, navigate directory structures, and handle path-related tasks. This makes it essential for automating and managing file-related tasks in scripts and applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "- Although Python automates memory management through garbage collection and reference counting, challenges still arise such as memory leaks caused by circular references, keeping large unused objects in memory, or improper use of global variables. Performance issues may also result from inefficient memory allocation, particularly in data-intensive applications. Developers need to monitor memory usage and use tools like gc and memory profilers to avoid such problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "- To raise an exception manually in Python, you use the raise statement followed by an exception type. For example, raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\") will trigger a ValueError with the specified message. This is useful when you want to enforce certain conditions in your code or create custom error messages for better clarity and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "- Multithreading is important in applications that involve I/O-bound tasks such as file operations, network requests, or user interactions, where the program would otherwise remain idle waiting for an operation to complete. By using threads, these tasks can run concurrently, improving responsiveness and performance. Although Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit true parallel execution, multithreading still allows better utilization of time in such scenarios."
